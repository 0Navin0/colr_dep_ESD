*.json files -->these are theoretical lensing and clustering signals obtained using weaklens_pipeline and AUM resp.
*.config --> the config file used to get the observed weak lensing signal from weaklens_pipeline. this file contains info of what all have been done while caclulating the w.l. signal. 

....in these plots AUM calculates ESD at 15 input projected radii points...which are taken from the files which have observed signals.
In these plots, I've removed those data points out of 15 for which I had 'nan' outputs in the 'observed' signal files.(but negative 'deltasigma'(observed) points are still there.)

bin5 ---> same thing for 5 radial bins
bin10 ---> for 10 radial bins
colr_dep_ESD+Wp.py : calculates ESD
