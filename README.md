# colr_dep_ESD

Code to use AUM to get ESD with TINK==2(HODs interpolated)

Uses outputted color dep hods from "hod_red_blue" project as points for interpolation in AUM. 

# Particular use case

1)Compare this ESD to confirm/reject the predictions given in arXiv:1902.01566. 

2)To decide if we need to include more effects into the modelling?
The halo-mass only model (arXiv:1902.01566) is on its own good enough before even thinking of refinements by adding other effects?
