# colr_dep_wp_ESD

Code to use AUM to get wp_ESD with TINK==2(HODs interpolated)

# Particular use case

1)Compare this wp_ESD to confirm/reject the predictions given in arXiv:1902.01566. 

2)To decide if we need to include more effects into the modelling?
The halo-mass only model (arXiv:1902.01566) is on its own good enough before even thinking of refinements by adding other effects?
