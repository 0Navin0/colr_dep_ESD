the clustering signal of red and blue galaxies is different in the same magnitude bin.

Since we can produce the clustering signals of these different color galaxies from HOD models, that mean these differences in signals due to red/blue color, give us a way to probe the HOD models in color dependent way in different luminosity bins.

Q1 - Since for large r_p values the red and blue signals seem close enough in all the bins...and as we looks these singals at lower and lower r_p values, they seem to differ a lot....why? what does it indicate? I can answer this question if i understand what does w_p mean as a function of r_p?
